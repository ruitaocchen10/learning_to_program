Space Complexity - the amount of computing memory needed to solve an algorithmic problem

It's a function of the input

Key aspects 
• Space used by the input
• Temporal space used by the algorithm, including variables and other data structures

O(1) - Uses fixed amount of memory regardless of input size
O(n) - Grows linearly with input size
O(n^2) - Grows exponentially with input size
